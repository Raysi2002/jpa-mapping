To properly implement a many-to-many relationship between the Author and Book entities, you need to specify the @ManyToMany annotation on one side and optionally use mappedBy on the other side to define the inverse relationship. Let’s break it down step by step.

1. Where to Mention the Many-to-Many Relationship?
   •	You must mention the @ManyToMany relationship in both entities, but only one side should own the relationship (typically the side where the join table is explicitly defined).
   •	The owning side is where the @JoinTable is defined, which specifies the join table and the foreign key mappings.
   •	The inverse side simply uses mappedBy to indicate that the relationship is already managed by the other side.

2. Corrected Code with Proper Mapping

Here’s how you can implement the many-to-many relationship:

Author Entity (Owning Side)

package com.raysi.springdatajpamapping.entity;

import jakarta.persistence.*;
import jakarta.validation.constraints.Email;
import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

import java.util.List;

@Entity
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
@Data
public class Author {
@Id
@GeneratedValue(
strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE,
generator = "author_seq"
)
@SequenceGenerator(
name = "author_seq",
sequenceName = "author_sequence",
allocationSize = 116
)
private Long authorId;

    private String firstName;
    private String middleName;
    private String lastName;

    @Email
    private String authorEmail;
    private String phoneNo;

    @ManyToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinTable(
            name = "author_books", // Name of the join table
            joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "author_id"), // Foreign key for Author
            inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "book_id") // Foreign key for Book
    )
    private List<Book> books;
}

Book Entity (Inverse Side)

package com.raysi.springdatajpamapping.entity;

import jakarta.persistence.*;
import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

import java.util.List;

@Entity
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
@Data
public class Book {
@Id
@GeneratedValue(
strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE,
generator = "book_seq"
)
@SequenceGenerator(
name = "book_seq",
sequenceName = "book_sequence",
allocationSize = 116
)
private Long bookId;

    private String bookName;
    private String genre;

    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "books") // Inverse side
    private List<Author> authors;
}

3. What Parameters Do You Need to Add?
   •	@JoinTable: Defines the name of the join table and the foreign key columns for both entities.
   •	cascade = CascadeType.ALL: Ensures changes in one entity are propagated to the related entities.
   •	mappedBy: Used in the inverse side to indicate which field owns the relationship.

4. How It Works
   •	The Author entity is the owning side because it defines the @JoinTable.
   •	The Book entity is the inverse side, and its authors field is mapped by the books field in Author.

5. Example Data Flow
   •	If you save an Author with a list of Book objects, the relationship will be persisted automatically in the author_books join table.

6. Database Structure

Assuming the above code, the database will have:
1.	author table (fields: author_id, first_name, last_name, etc.)
2.	book table (fields: book_id, book_name, genre, etc.)
3.	author_books table (fields: author_id, book_id)

7. Test Code

To verify the mapping, you can use a service or a test case:

@Autowired
private AuthorRepository authorRepository;

@Autowired
private BookRepository bookRepository;

@Test
public void testManyToManyMapping() {
// Create books
Book book1 = new Book();
book1.setBookName("Spring Boot Mastery");
book1.setGenre("Technology");

    Book book2 = new Book();
    book2.setBookName("Java Basics");
    book2.setGenre("Technology");

    // Create author
    Author author = new Author();
    author.setFirstName("Aashish");
    author.setLastName("Kumar Ray");
    author.setAuthorEmail("aashish@example.com");
    author.setBooks(List.of(book1, book2));

    // Save author (cascade saves books as well)
    authorRepository.save(author);
}

8. Debugging Tips
   •	Check the author_books table to ensure the relationships are persisted correctly.
   •	If you encounter issues, use spring.jpa.show-sql=true and spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true in application.properties to debug the SQL queries.

9. Why This Works

This structure ensures a clear ownership model, proper foreign key relationships, and avoids common pitfalls like infinite recursion during serialization.
